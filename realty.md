## Chapter 2: Overview
1. Plan 
	- identify all your assests and resources
	- create a 10 year plan to give structure to your investing
	- stick to the plan no matter what and keep reinvesting your profits, especially in the early years. Scrape the most out of your profits
2. Find
	- single family homes with 3+ bedrooms and with 15%+ equity
	- need to know where to look, how to look, what to look for, and speed
	- the right property:
		- only single-family homes (not townhomes, condods, duplexes, multiplexes)
		- never invest in homes priced above the median in the area. This will increase the risk of losing equity from market volatility and being unable to resell for a profit
		- the price range of entry-level to median will always have a market no matter how bad the market is
		- only buy homes in livable condition (want least amount of investment to make it resellable). Don't waste time on fixer-uppers. Ugly, but livable houses can still produce huge cash flows, but they must be in good enough condition that we can find tenants/potential buyers for them.
	- power of speed:
		- be prepared to purchase homes beforehand (be prequalified by a mortage broker)
		- be the first to find deals
		- have efficient negotiation (same day!)
			- avoid tedious counteroffers, cut to the chase
3. Purchase
	- use the right broker, select the right loans, manage your debt-to-income ratio
	- the right broker: find the right mortgage broker who understands how to finance multiple properties on one person’s credit
	- select the right loans: Also, maximizing the benefits of our formula requires that investors learn how to become profit conscious, rather than rate conscious. Higher interest rates can make investors more money than lower rates. Because the goal is to finance as many homes as possible, each additional property may be funded at a higher interest rate. Paying higher interest rates to particular banks enables us to purchase twice the investment properties as compared to what we could do if we went with the banks with the lowest rates
	- optimize debt-to-income ratio through compassionate financing. The higher your debt is relative to your income, the less likely you are to get additional loans. Through Compassionate Financing, our proprietary hybrid rent-to-own system, you can collect between $300 and $600 per month more than is possible through renting out properties. This offsets the debt incurred by additional loans and increases your ability to purchase additional investment properties. This is opposed to renting, where your debt-to-income ratio worsens with each transaction, and usually kills your ability to grow your portfolio after you’ve purchased a couple of homes.

4. Serve through compassionate financing
	- rent-to-own program similar to lease options. It’s a powerful and highly profitable system for the following reasons: 1) it incorporates the best elements of lease options while eliminating the flaws, 2) it relieves investors of the time and effort required to maintain rentals, 3) it generates much higher profits than either rentals or flipping, and 4) it provides substantial benefits to tenants.
	- Unlike rentals, with Compassionate Financing there is no property maintenance for investors, since the contract stipulates that tenants are responsible for all maintenance. The only time and effort involved is in marketing the property, screening tenants, and putting contracts in place.
