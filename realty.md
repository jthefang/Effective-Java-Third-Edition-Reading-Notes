## Chapter 2: Overview
1. Plan 
	- identify all your assests and resources
	- create a 10 year plan to give structure to your investing
	- stick to the plan no matter what and keep reinvesting your profits, especially in the early years. Scrape the most out of your profits
2. Find
	- single family homes with 3+ bedrooms and with 15%+ equity
	- need to know where to look, how to look, what to look for, and speed
	- the right property:
		- only single-family homes (not townhomes, condods, duplexes, multiplexes)
		- never invest in homes priced above the median in the area. This will increase the risk of losing equity from market volatility and being unable to resell for a profit
		- the price range of entry-level to median will always have a market no matter how bad the market is
		- only buy homes in livable condition (want least amount of investment to make it resellable). Don't waste time on fixer-uppers. Ugly, but livable houses can still produce huge cash flows, but they must be in good enough condition that we can find tenants/potential buyers for them.
	- power of speed:
		- be prepared to purchase homes beforehand (be prequalified by a mortage broker)
		- be the first to find deals
		- have efficient negotiation (same day!)
			- avoid tedious counteroffers, cut to the chase
